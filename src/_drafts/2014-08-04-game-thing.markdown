The realm of game design is an academic nightmare. From the industrial nature of most commercial 
games development, to the seemingly endless stream of exploitative video game trade schools, formal 
understandings of game design appear to just evaporate into the endless ether of game dev turnover. 
From the same mouths ruthlessly laying off employees and silencing creativity in
commercial game development studios, you might've heard rumor of the Dark Age of Games. 

For commercial games, you could pretty say we've **always** been in the Stone Age, and that won't 
change. Although game design is young, and the academics haven't yet come to liberate us with their 
noble white-papers (mind you, they will eventually), the spice will continue to flow, and huge 
corporations will continue to hold onto whatever has shown to make them the most money; that's their 
business. Literally. 

If we turn our specter (notably **not** our *Warren* specter) these times are 
absolutely not the dark age of video games, nor are the times to come, as contemporary, independent 
developers are harboring complex, deep understandings of the mechanics of games, without the 
academic systems that usually accelerate the innovation of systems so complex. These developers 
have designed amazing games that are actively pushing game design into the future, with games like 
Gone Home, Mountain, and Depression Quest. And I believe the body of this understanding isn't out of 
existing games leading by example; behind the curtains of the innovation of modern game design is 
newfound diversity and accessibility in game development.

As touched upon by Chris Crawford in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajz_1TqccYA) video,
games have long been about improving cognitive skills, including spatial navigation, resource
management, puzzle solution, and hand-eye coordination; teaching these skills naturally being 
the easiest concept to translate into code from games that came before the era of the processor. 
Games have been a product of coding and processing, and since has remained insular against most 
artists interested in working in the medium. Tools for game development have now flourished, 
however. And so have the artists-turned-game-developers working with them.

And such is the dawn (or at least, moment in the spotlight) for social reasoning as a mechanic in 
video games, and probably more importantly, games realized as catalyst for social unity and support. 
It's no coincidence that gamers at large are commonly viewed as socially inhibited; our culture and
media have done everything in their power to avoid the difficulties of interpersonal communication.
The social influence of patriarchal culture is especially prevalent in games communities, where
exclusion, social violence, and impersonal, transient relationships are the norm. Contemporary game
designers don't reject non-socially reasoned games, but are p
